JS Safari Reader source code and explanation

## Get latest source

	Follow http://blog.manbolo.com/2013/03/18/safari-reader-source-code
	Open safari web inspector.
	Disable (pause) Javascript in the Safari console debugger.
	Open a web page like this one (http://blog.manbolo.com/2012/11/20/using-xcode-opengl-es-frame-capture) (no affiliation).
	
	It does not work on any web page (the page needs to be "readable" and have no other JS errors, otherwise you wont see the source pop out).

There are three Javascript files so far. You can find them by either stepping through the break, setting breakpoints, and find the source references.
